# Text-To-Time

Text-to-Time is a small project created in Javascript to turn inputted integer values for time into text.

## Installation

Clone the GIT Repository and open index.html in any modern browser.

## Usage
The page contained two integer input boxes for hours and minutes and they can receive values from 1-12 and 0-59, respectively. When the values are changed in either input, a text conversion of the time is displayed below. Any values outside of the range will result in an error of the time being incomputable.
